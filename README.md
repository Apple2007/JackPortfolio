# Jack's Portfolio (aka JackPortfolio)

Hello! This is the Git Repository to my website hosted on [old.jackshorenstein.com](https://old.jackshorenstein.com)! The website is hosted on an Raspberry Pi at my house (meaning it is self-hosted). With that, I really hope you like this and you use the design in your own projects.

P.S. - Please credit me and the original creator of the site (which is [nineties.website](https://nineties.website)) when using this webiste design in your own projects! Thanks!
